This is a Bitcoin qt wrapper for .NET. It is written in C#.

It is made in june 2013 containing all methods in the Bitcoin-qt API (few exceptions such as multi-signature addresses).

Besides the C# wrapper which can be used in any kind of project, there is a MVC 4 project using the Bitcoin wrapper. Here the methods are called using jQuery (AJAX), to show how to get information from the running Bitcoin server to the client.
